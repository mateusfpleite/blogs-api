# Blogs API Project 

Project developed for Trybe's backend module, using mainly NodeJS, MySQL, Docker, Sequelize and JWT. The project is an API that allows users to create and update posts, retrieve or delete their own posts, and find other users. In addition, the project has an authentication system through tokens generated by the JWT, ensuring that a user is unable to perform operations on other users' posts.

<p>Use 'npm install' to install project dependencies</p>
<p>The project runs inside a docker container, so after 'npm install' you should run the command 'docker-compose up -d' inside root folder and the scripts specified in package.json should be used inside the container</p>
